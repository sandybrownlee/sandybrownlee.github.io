<p>
The <strong>Data science And Intelligent Systems (DAIS)</strong> Research Group are a group of academics, researchers and PhD students within the Division of Computing Science and Mathematics at the University of Stirling. We are interested in the <strong>development, theory, and application of data-driven methods to understand, model and optimise the world</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Data is all around us, and humanity generates over 2 quintillion bytes (that’s a 2 followed by 18 zeroes) of new data every day. Cutting-edge techniques are able to make sense of this data and explore it for the greater good. DAIS researchers have embraced data to: <strong>inform</strong> healthcare decisions through modern statistical analysis; <strong>assist</strong> those with impairments communicate, using machine learning algorithms to spot c at the momenomplex patterns in sound and brain patterns; <strong>predict</strong> outcomes of complex systems, with intelligent models that explain their decisions so that they can be trusted; <strong>perceive</strong> the world through computer vision to assist with sight loss and monitor our environment from space; <strong>schedule</strong> planes to arrive on time and <strong>design</strong> buildings to be more comfortable and energy efficient through advanced optimisation methods; and <strong>understand</strong> how all these techniques work and fit together using novel visualisations methods. These are just some of the areas where our group is advancing knowledge.
</p>
<p>
We are always happy to talk to companies and other academics about how we might work together. In the first instance please contact Dr Sandy Brownlee (alexander.brownlee@stir.ac.uk), DAIS group leader.

<h4>March 2025: Visitors</h4>
<p>This month we welcome <a href="https://ii.uni.wroc.pl/~lipinski/">Piotr Lipinski</a> and his PhD student Klaudia Balcer, from the University of Wroclaw. They are working with Sandy Brownlee and Giancarlo Catalano on explainability techniques in machine learning and optimisation.</p>

<h4>December 2024: British Academy grant success</h4>
<p>Congratulations go to Dr Yuanlin Gu, who has just started a British Academy funded project "Market Reactions to Managers' Accents in Earnings Conference Calls: a Machine Learning Approach". This is a collaboration between Stirling, St Andrews, and Birmingham, led by St Andrews. Stirling's role is to extract linguistic features from earnings calls and explore their impact on market responses. You can find more detail <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/news/over-17-million-in-british-academyleverhulme-trust-small-research-grants-awarded-to-support-shape-researchers/">here</a>.</p>

<h4>November 2024: PhD recruitment, and Paper</h4>
<p>Dr Ahsan Adeel is currently recruiting PhD students (closing date 19 November 2024), under the ARIA funded TREND project. See <a href="https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/DKK565/uk-aria-phd-network-project-economical-ai-chips-with-intrinsic-common-sense-and-morality">here</a> for more details. Dr Sandy Brownlee has a paper published in Automated Software Engineering journal, "Large Language Model Based Mutations in Genetic Improvement". A preprint can be found <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4437272/v1">here</a>. This month Dr Brownlee and Dr Leonardo Bezerra participated in the public launch of <a href="https://phawm.org">PHAWM</a> with some very useful interdisiplinary networking and interesting discussions. They were also delighted to join the discussions on AI and automation at an <a href="https://aiworkfutures.stir.ac.uk">event</a> organised by Stirling's social science faculty, and look forward to ongoing exploration of the social issues in this area.</p>

<h4>September 2024: Conference, Papers, and Another Welcome</h4>
<p>This month Prof Gabriela Ochoa attended <a href="https://ppsn2024.fh-ooe.at">PPSN</a> in Austria, having co-authored four papers there. Dr Sandy Brownlee's co-authored survey paper "Evolutionary Computation and Explainable AI: A Roadmap to Transparent Intelligent Systems" has just been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. A preprint can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07811">ArXiv</a>. We also welcome Jakub Konopka, who is starting a PhD under Jason Adair's supervision, looking at Optimising food growth in a Living lab environment. This is part of the University's Net Zero Communities cluster.</p>

<h4>July 2024: Conferences, Welcomes, and Farewells</h4>
<p><img src="/research/dais/images/news-gecco-2024.jpg" align="right" />In July Prof Gabriela Ochoa, Dr Sandy Brownlee, Dr Saemundur Haraldsson, Giancarlo Catalano, and Gudny Saemundsdottir travelled to Melbourne to attend the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO), the top conference in evolutionary computation. Gudny has just finished first year of her BSc Computing Science and was presenting a research project investigating generative AI and source code, "Large Language Models as All-in-one Operators for Genetic Improvement". Giancarlo also presented his first paper on MPhil work in explainable optimisation, "Mining Potentially Explanatory Patterns via Partial Solutions". In addition to several research presentations, Gabriela, Sandy and Saemi also chaired tutorials and workshops covering Landscape Aware Heuristic Search, Explainable AI, and Genetic Improvement of Software. Gabriela also chaired the Neuroevolution track and joined board meetings for SIGEVO, ECJ and TELO Journals.</p>
<p>Welcome to Dr Penny Johnston, who recently completed a PhD in Stirling and returns as a Research Fellow on the <a href="https://phawm.org">PHAWM</a> project, working with Dr Sandy Brownlee and Dr Leonardo Bezerra. Farewell and thanks to Dr Keiller Nogueira, who is moving to the University of Liverpool: we wish him all the best in his new role.</p>


<h4>May 2024: Industrial showcase, and Grant Success</h4>
<p><img src="/research/dais/images/news-indday-1.jpg" align="right" /><img src="/research/dais/images/news-indday-2.jpg" align="right" />The DAIS group hosted an industrial engagement event on 26 April, organised by Dr Jason Adair and Dr Sandy Brownlee. The event included success stories of academic/industrial partnerships, funding opportunities, and a poster session with lots of time for discussions between academics and visitors around potential projects. There was a real buzz about the day: around 15 external organisations participated with several follow-up meetings planned. We look forward to seeing what new partnerships emerge!</p>
<p>Dr Sandy Brownlee and Dr Leonardo Bezerra are pleased to share that they have been successful in winning a £410k grant from Responsible AI UK, part of the £3.5M project <a href="https://phawm.org">"Participatory Harm Auditing Workbenches and Methodologies" (PHAWM)</a> being led by the University of Glasgow. Stirling's part is largely focused on exploring fairness and bias in machine
learning algorithms. A full news story can be found <a href="https://www.stir.ac.uk/news/2024/may-2024-news/stirlings-ai-experts-to-join-multi-million-pound-project/">here</a>.</p>
