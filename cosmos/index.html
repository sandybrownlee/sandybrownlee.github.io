            <p>
               COSMoS aims to allow an exchange of skills with colleagues. We've set up COSMoS as a group which can meet monthly, be led by anyone in the department and used as a method of teaching each other via 1 hour open format sessions. This can range from advanced topics to sharing basic principles. 
            </p>
            <p>
               It's important to note this is not a research-based group - we already have these available. This is for the transfer of skills that you've picked up be you a researcher, lecturer, student or support staff. For further examples of possible subject areas, see below.

            <h3>"Poster Design and Communication"</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Author: <a href="http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~stb/">Scott Bee</a></li>
               <li>Date: TBA</li>
               <li>Abstract: <i> â€‹The best Academic Posters are those which can effectively summarise the important aspects of a given research topic, are easy to read and understand and are visually appealing. You want your poster to stand out and to leave the reader with more than a cursory knowledge of your research topic, the research methods you employed and your research findings. Creating an effective academic poster can be tricky business.</i></li>

               <li>This COSMoS Session will focus on:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Designing poster with an awareness of intended audience and/or the assessment criteria.</li>
                  <li>Discussing the Poster Presentation Life Cycle.</li>
                  <li>Demonstrating different pieces of current technology. </li>
                  <li>Discussion of good practices and other tips and tricks.</li>

               <li>Abstract: <i>We will be dealing with three papers, two pages each. One is interesting for the topic, one has 13k+ citations, one is on a very interesting topic.  The goal of this session is to discuss an approach to reading scientific papers effectively, and to compare it with other/our existing approaches. Accessible to anyone, it will be a hands-on session/discussion. If someone can guess the three papers (or some of  them), send me an e-mail.</i></li>

            <!---<h3>"Python Notebooks and GPU Programming with Tensorflow"</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Author: <a href="http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kms/">Dr Kevin Swingler</a></li>
               <li>Date: January</li>
               <li>Abstract: <i> We have a nice new machine in Computing and Maths, with plenty of memory, CPUs and GPUs. In this talk, I will describe one way of accessing the machine and making use of its computational power using Python via a Jupyter notebook. I'll look at how Google's Tensorflow and associated projects make the process easier. This will interest you if you are doing machine learning, optimisation, or other large scale computations, especially if linear algebra is involved.</i>
