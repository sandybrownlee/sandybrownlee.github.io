               <li>Abstract: <i>Impact is a major buzzword for REF and the funding councils. It's all about how our research makes a difference outside of academia: where it happens it can be very rewarding as well as being a good thing from a funding perspective. We'll look at the topic in more detail in this session. Further details TBC.</i></li>

               <li>Abstract: <i>In this session we will look at some of the data on equality within computing and maths (more broadly than the department) and touch on unconscious bias. I will also look at some hints and tips on how to support one another, particularly by being an active bystander. Although the material comes from discussions about women in STEM they are much more broadly applicable than that. One the best “justifications” I have heard for making these changes is that good practice benefits everyone but bad practice has a disproportionate impact on women (and other minorities) .</i>

In this session I will look at tips and tricks for how to carry out research more effectively with limited time. Most of these ideas will be taken from the book “the productive researcher” by Mark Reed, mixed with some more personal observations.

               <li>Abstract: <i>Version control allows you to automatically track changes to a software project over time, enabling the ability experiment with and revert changes, and to merge contributions with collaborators. Git is currently the most used version control system. It was built by Linux-creator Linus Torvalds, and is used to manage changes to the Linux kernel. Even Microsoft is in the process of migrating Windows development to Git. No discussion of Git would be complete without GitHub, a free, web-based storage platform for your Git repositories. GitHub acts as a home for hosting and contributing to open-source projects such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, the Android operating system, and many more. In this seminar we will demonstrate how to get started hosting your project with Git and GitHub, and how to use GitHub to manage your project with branching, issue tracking, releases, and continuous integration. We will also see how to use GitHub to contribute to open-source projects with forks and pull-requests.</i>

               <li>Abstract: <i>This will take the form of a brief introduction, followed by a discussion. The discussion will be on some specific points about making the transitions from PhD student to paid researcher to lecturer/assistant professor. There’s no simple answer: each person who has achieved a measure of success (counting success as getting the RA/RF post, the lectureship/assistant professorship, the SL/associate professorship, the Readership, the Full Professorship as success: certainly not financial success!) has done it in a different way. But there are some things in common, and perhaps some things to avoid.

               <li>Abstract: <i>The Java language has included threads from the very first version, back in 1994. Multi-threading supported the development of features such as responsive GUI and garbage-collection. Today, with multi-core CPUs replacing the old Moore’s law of ever-increasing CPU clock speeds, it is becoming increasingly important to take advantage of threads. This talk will provide a primer for writing concurrent code with threads. We will see what can go wrong when threads share variables and objects. We will discuss levels of thread-safety, and how we can write thread-safe applications using locks, thread-isolation, state minimisation, lock-free concurrency, and concurrent collections.

               <li>Abstract: <i>We are all used to the idea of communicating our research to a specialised audience either via peer reviewed journal papers or through talks at conferences.
               However, nowadays we can make user of social media both to make the specialised audience aware when we publish and to reach a wider audience. This should result in more citations and a wider uptake of our research . Some of this needs to be done by us as individuals but much of it can be done through the new departmental initiatives to enhance our external (and internal) profile.
               In this session I will discuss some of the options open to us including twitter, Kudos, writing for the Conversation and writing blogs. I will also tell you how to make the most of what we are doing as a department so that you can get maximum impact for minimum effort.</i></li>

               <li>Abstract: <i>2016 was a weird year for me. On the plus side I was one of twelve women in Computing and Mathematics to receive a Suffrage Science Award, recognising both scientific achievement and ability to inspire others. I’m involved in lots of work to promote careers in science for women, having initiated and led the Athena SWAN programme of actions at Stirling for four years, and started building Cygnets: a good practice network of UK computing departments engaged in gender equality work.  But 2016 was also one of the worst years of my life, with lots of stress, and consequent depression. I'll talk about my journey from student to professor, with some thoughts about the people and qualities that lead to success, and how those qualities can also be enemies. This should be relevant for everyone, no matter their career stage, academic or professional services, or discipline. (Spoiler alert: I don’t have the answers!)</i></li>

               <li>Abstract: <i>Most Java developers have encountered generics at some point. Introduced in Java 5.0, generics provide compile-time type safety for homogeneous collections and eliminate the need for much explicit runtime type casting. However, the addition of generics to the language brings a lot of complexity in the form of parameterized types, unbounded and covariant/contravariant unbounded wildcards, generic methods, and runtime type erasure. In this this session we will see how to start using generics to increase the flexibility and reusability of your code with maintain compile time type safety, demystify some of the complexity, and avoid some of the pitfalls you may encounter along the way.</i></li>

               <li>Date: Friday February 24th, 1500-1600, 4B96.</li>
               <li>Abstract: <i>Data Scientists' job rely on having access to (large) datasets. However, the data is not always directly available to be processed and analysed; it often needs to be retrieved initially from external sources. Such sources may be an API (application protocol interface) or even web pages from the Internet. Web Scraping or Web Harvesting is the technique of extracting large amounts of information directly from the source code standing behind web pages. During this seminar we will have a quick overview of the Python tools available to perform Web Scraping. A fter this, our focus will shift to Scrapy, an elaborated, free, open-source, web crawling framework written in Python. After explaining the framework's overall structure and its main components, we will see Scrapy in action during an interactive session; this will be done by coding some scripts that are able to recursively collect information from thousands of web pages. During the last stage of the seminar, we will learn how to select, retrieve and store specific information from web pages.

               <li>Abstract: <i>Writing is an important skill: and one we all need to master. 
               There is no silver bullet, but here are a list of tips and dos and don't. 
               I have been to all the writing course given at Stirling - so this is just a short overview. 
               This session is about sharing any ideas and avoiding pitfalls.
               I hope some of the techniques work for you. </i></li>

]               <li>Abstract: <i>LaTeX is a powerful document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. The talk will cover different aspects of creating a technical document, from the compilation pipeline to handling floats gracefully.The aim of the talk is to lessen LaTeX's learning curve for motivated beginners and provide general tips and tricks for the more advanced user. Part 2 (date TBC) will cover more specific topics such as Beamer presentations and different packages.</i></li>

               <li>Abstract: <i>Like other massively successful organizations and tools, when the search engine became viral the proper noun became a verb, and now we all Google, and no longer surf the web. Almost two decades since the inception of the Google search engine, most people still use it as a simple keyword search tool. Yet Google now has the capability for specific file type searches, powerful remote desktop capabilities, cloud storage, simultaneous multi-user spreadsheet usage, document editor, PowerPoint creating tools, and smart artificial intelligence embedded into its search engine to help us with daily tasks based on your individual preferences and situations. The debate as to whether the cost of our data is worth the use of these powerful toolsets is ever ongoing, but one thing is for certain: these tools can certainly make your life easier.</i></li>

               <li>Abstract: <i>We will look at two “simple” models of computation; finite state automata (FSA) and Turing Machines (TM). Regarding FSA, we will look at their relationship to regular expressions, their equality, and minimization. Regarding TMs, we will look at universal TM, the halting problem, Rice’s theorem, and the Church/Turing thesis.</i> </li>
